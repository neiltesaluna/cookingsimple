This is the **quick version** of the filipino hot and sour soup. With a tamarind and pork broth base, this is a delicious combination to cure a running nose during the colder months. In this method we will be using an **electric pressure cooker**, making it easier for the pork to fall off the bone.

**Serves:** 6 people  
**Preparation Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cooking Time:** 60 minutes  

**Ingredients:**
- 1 kg of pork ribs *(can use pork bones and/or pork belly as a substitute)*
- 1 bunch of water spinach, cut in half *(can use spinach or bok choy as a substitute)*
- 1 large yellow onion, julienne cuts
- 1 tomato, don't cut this but give is a good rinse
- 1 small white radish, peeled and 10 mm paysanne cuts
- 1 green cayenne pepper, cut into halves *(can add a hotter pepper as a substitute)*
- 3 tablespoon fish sauce
- 2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 44 g Tamarind soup base powder (we are using [**Knorr Sinigang sa Sampalok Original**](https://www.knorr.com/ph/knorr-products/knorr-sinigang-mix/knorr-sinigang-sa-sampalok-original.html))

**Directions:**
- Give the pork ribs a good rinse with water, then add it into the pressure cooker

- Evenly coat the pork with the Tamarind soup base powder

- Add the 2 teaspoon of ground black pepper

- Evenly distribute the julienne cut onions

- Place 1 whole tomato in the centre of the pressure cooker

- Place the 2 halves of the green cayenne pepper into the pressure cooker

- Add the paysanne cut radish to cover the other ingredients

- Place the water spinach evenly above the radish

- Slowly pour 2 litres of water into the pressure cooker, making sure this doesn't agitate the ingredients

- Add 3 tablespoon of fish sauce into the mixture

- Now we can close the lid of the pressure cooker and set to cook for 25 minutes

- Once the pressure cooker is finished, carefully relieve the pressure using the vent

- Once vented, break the tomato by pushing it down with a ladle and give the soup a good mix

- Serve into single small bowls or a nice big one for the family to share
