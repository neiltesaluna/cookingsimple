- Serves: 2 people
- Preparation Time: 5 minutes
- Cooking Time: 5 minutes

ingredients:
- 3 eggs
- 2 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup cheese (Pecorino Romano), grated

- 1 tablespoon crème fraîche
- Kosher salt
- Ground black pepper

directions:
- In a bowl, combine the 3 eggs

- At low-medium heat, add 2 tablespoon of unsalted butter into the saucepan (move this around the saucepan until foaming)
- Add the egg mixture into the saucepan
- Whilst moving the saucepan back and forth, mix the contents vigorously (this reduces the size of the curds)
- Once the egg mixture starts to come together, turn off the heat

- Serve onto your breakfast plate
- Grate the cheese above the plate, in this case we are using Pecorino Romano (a bit salty)
